# POD Artwork Reconstruction Tool

> **Status:** Canonical design document — standalone-tool architecture
> **Role:** Source of truth for POD artwork reconstruction, quality, learning, harness, logging and update decisions.

## 1. Product definition

The product is a **standalone desktop tool** that runs on the user's local machine:

```text
Open POD Artwork Tool
        ↓
Drag/drop or upload one or more reference images
        ↓
Tool analyzes and reconstructs the artwork
        ↓
Tool performs quality checks and targeted repair
        ↓
User reviews the result
        ↓
Export clean 2D artwork
```

The primary user experience is intentionally simple: **Input → Process → Output**.

Internally the tool may use local GPU models, deterministic image processing and remote AI providers, but those implementation details should normally remain hidden from the user.

The primary output is a clean 2D artwork master suitable for POD production. A 4500×5400 RGBA PNG with 300-DPI metadata is the default delivery profile, but print quality is determined by actual detail, text, edges, alpha and fidelity rather than file dimensions alone.

## 2. Product UX

```

The main workflow must not expose queue internals, model names, worker topology, harness configuration or learning internals unless the user opens Advanced/Developer views.

### 2.1 Quality modes

- **Quick 2D:** prioritize turnaround time; produce a reviewable clean 2D draft quickly.
- **Print Ready:** default mode; use smart routing, local precision finish and full QC.
- **Max Fidelity:** use stronger analysis, alternate candidates where justified, targeted rescue and stricter QC.

A Quick 2D result can be upgraded to Print Ready or Max Fidelity from cached/checkpointed artifacts without repeating valid earlier stages.

## 3. Canonical system architecture

The desktop application is one product but internally separates UI and processing so heavy GPU work or model failure does not freeze the interface.

              │                     ▼
              └────────────────── Output
```

If the engine process fails, the UI remains alive, the failure is logged and the job resumes from the latest valid checkpoint when possible.

`*` Concrete provider/model names are provider mappings selected by benchmark and are not permanent architecture.

## 5. Pre-flight and source quality

Pre-flight runs before expensive AI work.

It should determine:

- file hash and duplicate status;
- dimensions and format;
- source quality;
- blur/compression severity;
- transparency if present;
- orientation;
- likely artwork region;
- whether the input belongs to an existing artwork identity;
- quality mode, priority and optional budget constraints.

If an identical or equivalent artwork already has a valid master, the system may reuse it instead of repeating reconstruction.

## 6. Artwork Identity and multi-reference fusion

One artwork may have multiple references:

```text
artwork_001/
  front.jpg
  closeup.jpg
  model.jpg
  side.jpg
```

All references should map to one `artwork_identity`.

The system should use multiple references when available to reduce hallucination and recover information hidden by perspective, wrinkles, hands, folds or poor framing.

Multi-reference fusion may:

- select the clearest region from each image;
- estimate perspective/dewarp transforms;
- build a shared evidence map;
- identify mutually consistent details;
- mark unresolved regions as low confidence.

Do not force one arbitrarily selected image to be the sole source when better evidence exists across several references.

## 7. DesignSpec and typed control plane

The analyzer creates a structured `DesignSpec` containing, where available:

- artwork bounding region;
- exact recognized text and line order;
- objects and relative positions;
- layout/composition;
- dominant colors;
- style/texture classes;
- gradient/metallic/distress/watercolor/glow indicators;
- perspective/warp severity;
- occlusion;
- confidence by region/element;
- preservation constraints;
- recommended capabilities required.

Use a strict typed/validated control plane such as JEV TypeSafe or an equivalent implementation for:

```text
DesignSpec
RouteDecision
ProviderRequest
ProviderResult
JudgeResult
QCResult
RetryDecision
ArtifactManifest
ExportProfile
UserFeedback
JobExperience
LearningRecommendation
```

All contracts are versioned.

Invalid structured output must not silently continue. The system should attempt bounded deterministic repair, structured retry, fallback or manual review.

AI models provide observations; validated policy code decides routing, retries, fallback and escalation unless a learned policy has explicitly passed promotion gates.

## 8. Smart Router

Routing is capability-based, not hard-coded around model names.

Example capabilities:

```text
need_fast_draft
need_semantic_reconstruction
need_exact_text
need_complex_texture
need_region_rescue
need_vector
need_high_resolution
need_fallback
```

Typical routes:

### 8.1 Deterministic route

Preferred for text/logo/geometric work when reliable reconstruction is possible:

```text
OCR
→ exact text verification
→ font/layout/style analysis
→ vector/shape rebuild
→ high-resolution render
```

### 8.2 Local AI route

Used for illustration, material separation, semantic reconstruction, SR or other operations where a benchmarked local model performs well.

### 8.3 Remote AI route

Used for:

- Quick 2D;
- difficult semantic reconstruction;
- severe deformation/occlusion;
- local-model failure;
- region rescue;
- fallback when local compute is unavailable.

### 8.4 Hybrid route

Use AI for semantic recovery and deterministic/local precision processing for exact text, vectors, gradients, texture, SR, alpha, edge and final composition.

## 9. Reconstruction quality principles

### 9.1 Text and logo

Final glyphs should not depend on a generative image model when deterministic reconstruction is possible.

Any text mismatch is a QC failure.

### 9.2 Illustration

Preserve intentional visual texture while removing garment/fabric effects.

### 9.3 Mixed artwork

Separate typography/vector-capable elements from illustration/texture and composite them after reconstruction.

### 9.4 Material separation

Observed pixels may contain:

```text
Artwork Base              → keep/reconstruct
Artwork Texture           → keep/reconstruct
Garment/Fabric Texture    → remove
Lighting/Shadow           → remove
Wrinkle/Geometry          → correct
Compression/Noise         → reduce/remove
```

The core challenge is distinguishing intentional artwork texture from product texture.

## 10. Difficult gradients and textures

- **Smooth gradients:** use vector/procedural gradients where fit is reliable.
- **Metallic/gold/specular:** use sharp masks plus high-resolution raster/procedural texture and highlight information.
- **Watercolor/distressed/grunge:** preserve as high-resolution raster texture/masks.
- **Glow/semi-transparency:** retain high-precision alpha handling.
- **Texture synthesis:** allowed only when source detail is insufficient; generated detail must be treated as plausible synthesis, not recovered ground truth.

## 11. Artifact DAG, checkpoints and cache

The processing pipeline is a dependency graph rather than a monolithic script.

Each stage should be reproducible from:

```text
input artifact hash
+
configuration hash
+
model/provider version
+
prompt/policy/schema version
```

Each successful stage emits an immutable artifact record.

Benefits:

- resume after crash;
- avoid repeating expensive AI calls;
- upgrade Quick 2D to Print Ready without restarting;
- rerun only SR/alpha/export when upstream artifacts remain valid;
- reuse identical preprocessing across benchmark recipes;
- support reproducible debugging.

A stage must be idempotent where practical.

## 12. Master artifact representation

A design may retain:

```text
master/
  source/
  preflight.json
  design_spec.json
  ocr.json
  confidence_map
  evidence_map
  vector/
    typography
    line_art
    geometry
    gradients
  raster/
    illustration
    watercolor
    distress
    metallic/detail textures
  masks/
    alpha
    texture
    edge
  candidates/
  qc/
  artifact_manifest.json
  final_master
```

Internally use higher precision and a working resolution above delivery size where beneficial.

## 13. Two-stage quality control

Do not collapse all quality checks into one score.

### 13.1 QC Gate #1 — Semantic/source fidelity

Checks:

- exact text;
- layout/composition;
- object presence and shape;
- color;
- missing regions;
- source similarity;
- intentional texture;
- unresolved/occluded areas.

### 13.2 QC Gate #2 — Technical print quality

Checks:

- effective resolution;
- edge sharpness;
- aliasing;
- halo;
- alpha;
- blur;
- line survival;
- transparent-pixel contamination;
- output dimensions/profile;
- color-space/export validity.

A candidate must pass both gates for Print Ready.

AI Judge is only one evaluator. Final QC may combine OCR, CV/perceptual metrics, edge metrics, alpha metrics, technical validation and human review.

## 14. Region rescue and bounded retries

If only part of a design fails, do not regenerate the entire image by default.

```text
candidate
   ↓
failed region detected
   ↓
crop + context + mask
   ↓
local or remote rescue
   ↓
merge into locked good regions
   ↓
re-run targeted QC
```

Retries are bounded.

Failure type determines the action:

```text
TEXT_FIDELITY_FAILED  → deterministic text repair
TEXTURE_FAILED        → texture/local/remote region rescue
ALPHA_FAILED          → alpha stage rerun
PROVIDER_ERROR        → provider fallback
OUT_OF_MEMORY         → lower-memory route / alternate worker/provider
SOURCE_INSUFFICIENT   → manual review / alternate reference
```

## 15. Export profiles

Do not hard-code the entire architecture to one output size.

Default POD profile:

- PNG;
- 4500×5400;
- RGBA;
- transparent background;
- 300-DPI metadata.

An `ExportProfile` may additionally define:

- canvas dimensions;
- aspect behavior;
- color-space/ICC policy;
- transparency rules;
- safe margins;
- scaling;
- output formats.

Possible presets include Default POD, Printify, Printful and Custom.

The internal master is independent from delivery size so future exports do not require full reconstruction.

## 16. Job lifecycle and error taxonomy

Core states may include:

```text
queued
preflight
analyzing
dewarping
separating
reconstructing
judging
precision_finishing
upscaling
alpha_refining
qc
region_rescue
retrying
review_required
completed
failed_retryable
failed_final
cancel_requested
cancelled
resuming
waiting_provider
waiting_compute
blocked_budget
```

Use normalized failure categories such as:

```text
SOURCE_ERROR
PROVIDER_ERROR
COMPUTE_ERROR
QUALITY_FAILURE
POLICY_FAILURE
BUDGET_FAILURE
CANCELLED
```

This allows deterministic retry/fallback policy.

## 17. Logger, telemetry and diagnostics

Logging is mandatory from the first build.

Separate:

- **Operational logs:** app/engine/update/debug/errors.
- **Telemetry:** latency, resource use, retries, provider/model/version, quality metrics and cost where applicable.
- **Experience Store:** normalized long-lived learning evidence.

Suggested local structure:

```text
PODTool/
  logs/
    app.log
    engine.log
    updater.log
    jobs/
      <job_id>.jsonl
```

Each stage records at least:

- timestamp;
- job/trace ID;
- stage;
- provider/model/version;
- prompt/policy/schema version;
- attempt;
- duration;
- input/output artifact IDs;
- retry/failure reason;
- GPU/VRAM/RAM metrics where available;
- cost where applicable.

Logging must not block image processing.

### 17.1 Diagnostic bundle

The tool provides **Export Diagnostic Bundle**:

```text
diagnostic_<timestamp>.zip
  system.json
  gpu.json
  app-version.json
  updater.log
  recent-job-logs/
  health-report.json
  config-redacted.json
```

Never include secrets, credentials or API keys.

## 18. Auto-update and rollback

Auto-update is part of the foundation, not a later add-on.

Startup:

```text
Launch tool
    ↓
Updater bootstrap
    ↓
Check release manifest
    ↓
No update ─────────→ Start installed version
    ↓
Update available
    ↓
Download package
    ↓
Verify checksum/signature
    ↓
Backup current version
    ↓
Install
    ↓
Start + health check
    ├─ PASS → keep new version
    └─ FAIL → rollback automatically
```

If the update service or internet is unavailable, log a warning and start the installed version.

Support at least:

```text
stable
staging
```

The updater should be independent from the main engine so a broken release cannot prevent rollback.

## 19. Historical learning from existing input/final pairs

Existing historical data is a first-class starting asset.

```text
Historical Inputs
       +
Approved Finals
       ↓
Pairing
       ↓
Artwork Identity
       ↓
Normalization
       ↓
Historical Dataset
       ↓
Experience / Retrieval / Benchmark / Training
```

A historical record should link one or more product/reference images to one approved final artwork.

The system should support import from folders, filenames, SKU/design IDs or visual matching.

Do not immediately fine-tune on all historical data. Use it first for:

1. similar-case retrieval;
2. recipe learning;
3. router/provider evaluation;
4. QC/ranker development;
5. material-separation evaluation;
6. only later, justified local-model adaptation/fine-tuning.

## 20. Synthetic paired data

Approved clean masters can produce synthetic degraded references:

```text
clean master
   ↓
mockup simulator
   ├─ perspective
   ├─ wrinkle
   ├─ lighting
   ├─ garment texture
   ├─ blur/compression
   └─ partial occlusion
   ↓
synthetic product reference
```

Because the clean master is known, the pair becomes controlled training/evaluation data.

Synthetic data supplements real historical pairs; it must not replace real validation.

## 21. Dataset Registry and split rules

All datasets are versioned.

Never randomly split individual reference images if they show the same artwork.

Split by `artwork_identity` so one design cannot leak across train/validation/test.

A typical starting split may be:

```text
Train            75%
Validation       10%
Golden Holdout   15%
```

The Golden Holdout is never used for:

- training;
- prompt learning;
- router learning;
- retrieval memory.

It exists only for unbiased regression and promotion decisions.

## 22. Experience Store and continuous learning

Every eligible completed job can add evidence:

```text
input
DesignSpec
route
provider/model
candidate
QC
retry history
user feedback
final selected result
cost/latency/resource metrics
```

Learning occurs in layers:

1. **Experience retrieval:** use similar successful/failed cases.
2. **Recipe learning:** learn the best processing recipe for each artwork family.
3. **Policy learning:** improve route/provider/retry decisions.
4. **Prompt/parameter learning:** compare versioned alternatives.
5. **Model learning:** fine-tune/LoRA only after clean dataset evidence justifies it.

User feedback should support:

```text
Approve
Reject
Regenerate
Corrected
Final selected
```

Structured reasons may include wrong text/layout/object/color, lost texture, fake texture, blur, bad edges, bad alpha or excessive source deviation.

Corrected results create high-value preference pairs:

```text
undesired candidate → approved correction
```

## 23. Reconstruction Recipe memory

The system learns complete recipes rather than only “best model”.

Example:

```text
Artwork family: metallic logo

Best recipe:
vector extraction
→ precise geometry
→ metallic texture mask
→ alpha cleanup
→ high-resolution render
```

Another example:

```text
Artwork family: watercolor + typography

Best recipe:
semantic reconstruction
→ exact OCR/text rebuild
→ preserve raster watercolor
→ local SR
→ alpha refinement
```

Recipe quality is measured by the Harness.

## 24. Benchmark / Evaluation Harness

The Harness is a first-class subsystem, not a temporary script.

It does **not** process user production jobs directly. It measures whether a proposed change is better than the production champion.

```text

```

### 24.1 Benchmark case

Each benchmark case contains:

```text
case_id
artwork_identity
source reference set
approved target/master
metadata
exact text/constraints
difficulty/cohort labels
```

### 24.2 Benchmark recipes

The Harness compares **whole recipes**, not just models.

A recipe versions analyzer, dewarp, reconstruction, OCR, vectorization, SR, alpha, QC, prompt and routing settings.

### 24.3 Metrics

Semantic:

- exact text;
- composition/layout;
- object fidelity;
- color;
- texture fidelity;
- missing detail.

Technical:

- edge;
- alpha;
- halo/aliasing;
- blur;
- effective resolution;
- small-detail survival.

Operational:

- latency;
- GPU time;
- peak VRAM/RAM;
- retries;
- provider calls;
- cost;
- failure/manual-review rate.

### 24.4 Cohort evaluation

Results must be broken down by artwork category, for example:

```text
typography
logo
mixed
watercolor
metallic
distressed
flat illustration
heavy wrinkle
low resolution
heavy occlusion
```

Do not promote a change from average score alone if it causes a serious cohort regression.

### 24.5 Regression tiers

```text
Smoke Set
   ↓
Regression Set
   ↓
Golden Holdout
   ↓
Promotion Gate
```

### 24.6 Visual Diff

Harness UI should provide source/target/result comparison, synchronized 100/200/400% zoom, difference heatmaps and targeted crops for text, fine lines, gradient, texture and alpha edge.

### 24.7 Shadow evaluation

Production continues using the Champion while a Challenger may run on selected jobs without affecting user output.

No router/model/prompt/QC policy may self-promote based solely on AI Judge results.

## 25. Champion / Challenger promotion

Version:

- router;
- prompts;
- provider mapping;
- QC thresholds;
- recipes;
- model settings.

A challenger is promoted only after measured evidence shows acceptable quality and no critical regression, while cost/latency/resource use satisfies policy.

Production behavior must never mutate automatically from a few recent jobs.

## 26. Reproducibility and security

Every final master has an `ArtifactManifest` containing:

- source hashes;
- parent artifact hashes;
- model/provider versions;
- prompt/policy/schema versions;
- parameters and seed where supported;
- final export profile;
- QC report.

Text extracted from images is treated as **data**, never as executable model instructions.

Remote providers receive only required artifacts. Credentials are stored securely and never written to logs, diagnostics or datasets.

## 27. Standalone local deployment

The local Windows machine is the primary runtime and the architecture is optimized for the current hardware profile:

```text
CPU        Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4
Sockets    2
Cores      28 physical / 56 logical
RAM        64 GB
GPU        Radeon RX 470 8 GB
Storage    SSD
```

This machine is strong for highly parallel CPU work and large in-memory image processing, but the RX 470 8 GB must **not** be treated as the primary engine for modern large image-generation models. The production default is therefore **CPU-first + lightweight GPU acceleration + remote AI for semantic reconstruction**.

Suggested product components:

```text
PODArtworkTool.exe
  ├─ Desktop UI
  ├─ Engine Service/Process
  ├─ CPU image-processing runtime
  ├─ Lightweight GPU acceleration layer
  ├─ Remote AI provider adapters
  ├─ JEV/typed control plane
  ├─ Logger + Telemetry
  ├─ Auto Updater
  ├─ Checkpoint/cache manager
  ├─ Storage Manager
  └─ Dataset/Harness management
```

The tool should not require users to manually start Python or PowerShell in normal use.

### 27.1 Canonical execution policy for the current machine

Do not make local Qwen/FLUX-class large reconstruction models a required production dependency on this hardware. They may be benchmarked experimentally, but the default install must remain usable without them.

### 27.2 CPU utilization policy

The engine should exploit the 28-core/56-thread CPU without starving Windows or the desktop UI.

Recommended initial scheduler limits:

```text
Engine CPU soft budget     32–40 logical threads
UI/system reserve          remaining threads
RAM soft budget            ~32 GB
RAM hard budget            44–48 GB
```

Typical CPU responsibilities:

- OCR;
- pre-flight and deduplication;
- OpenCV transforms;
- perspective/dewarp;
- vector/text reconstruction;
- image compositing;
- masks and alpha processing where CPU wins;
- QC and benchmark metrics;
- dataset indexing and background preparation.

Independent CPU work should overlap remote-provider wait time. For example, OCR, masks, layout reconstruction and output-canvas preparation can run while a remote reconstruction request is in flight.

### 27.3 RX 470 policy

The RX 470 is an optional accelerator, not a mandatory dependency.

Benchmark lightweight tasks through available Windows acceleration backends such as DirectML/Vulkan-class paths where practical:

- lightweight segmentation/matting;
- selected SR models;
- image filters;
- narrowly scoped inference that fits comfortably in 8 GB VRAM.

If the GPU implementation is unstable or slower than CPU, the Router must automatically use the CPU path.

Do not make the following normal production requirements on this GPU:

```text
large local diffusion reconstruction
large local VLM
multiple resident AI models
VRAM-heavy Max Fidelity pipelines
```

### 27.4 Remote AI policy

Remote AI is used as elastic compute to avoid turning the RX 470 into the system bottleneck.

Use remote reasoning/vision for:

- DesignSpec generation when local evidence is insufficient;
- ambiguous or heavily occluded artwork;
- multi-reference reasoning;
- difficult semantic understanding;
- Judge assistance where deterministic metrics are insufficient.

Use remote image reconstruction for:

- Quick 2D;
- complex semantic reconstruction;
- difficult-region rescue;
- fallback after bounded local failure;
- Max Fidelity paths when evidence shows quality benefit.

Remote output is still an intermediate reconstruction. Final exact text, vector-capable geometry, alpha, edges, export profile and technical QC remain controlled by the local precision pipeline.

### 27.5 JEV / typed-control optimization

JEV/TypeSafe does not make image inference faster directly. Its performance value is preventing invalid structured output and bad routing decisions from wasting expensive stages.

The typed control plane validates:

```text
DesignSpec
RouteDecision
ProviderResult
QCResult
RetryDecision
ArtifactManifest
```

A malformed or incomplete result should fail within milliseconds/seconds at the contract boundary instead of continuing through reconstruction, SR, compositing and QC.

### 27.6 Hard storage budget

The entire installed tool footprint must stay within a **40 GB absolute cap**, excluding user-controlled historical source/final datasets stored outside the tool directory.

Target normal footprint:

```text
Core app/runtime               2–3 GB
OCR/matting/SR lightweight     2–4 GB
Pinned production models       0–6 GB
Persistent cache               ≤5 GB
Temporary jobs                 ≤6 GB
Harness/Golden subset          ≤2 GB
Logs                           ≤1 GB
Updater/rollback               ≤2 GB
Reserved headroom              ≥4 GB
--------------------------------------
Normal operating target        ~18–28 GB
Soft warning                   32 GB
Absolute hard limit            40 GB
```

Storage Manager automatically:

1. removes completed-job temporary artifacts no longer needed for resume;
2. evicts unpinned LRU model/cache data;
3. compresses/rotates logs;
4. deletes superseded update packages;
5. refuses optional model downloads that would exceed the hard cap;
6. uses a remote provider instead of downloading another large fallback model when appropriate.

Historical datasets are referenced by path/hash/metadata and are not copied into the tool installation by default.

### 27.7 Performance targets for this hardware profile

Initial engineering targets, to be replaced by Harness measurements:

```text
Typography/logo deterministic    8–20 s
Quick 2D                         15–45 s
Print Ready simple               20–45 s
Print Ready typical              30–90 s
Complex hybrid                   1–2 min
Region rescue                    +15–45 s
Max Fidelity                     1.5–4 min typical
Hard job ceiling                 6–8 min
```

These are SLO targets, not guaranteed benchmark results. Actual values depend on remote-provider latency, network, source complexity and the final selected algorithms.

The engine should stop unproductive retries before the hard ceiling and preserve artifacts for manual review or fallback.

## 28. Optional VPS role

A VPS is **optional**, not required for the basic standalone workflow.

Possible VPS responsibilities:

- update/release manifest hosting;
- optional telemetry aggregation;
- optional remote job history;
- optional centralized dataset registry;
- remote provider orchestration;
- multi-machine expansion later.

The standalone app must still process local jobs when the VPS is unavailable, except for features that explicitly require remote providers or update/telemetry services.

## 29. Recommended source structure

```text

│  ├─ ui/
│  └─ updater/

├─ engine/
│  ├─ preflight/

```

The architecture should keep provider adapters replaceable so model changes do not rewrite the core application.

## 31. Non-goals and truthfulness

- Do not claim 4500×5400 or 300-DPI metadata alone proves print quality.
- Do not claim exact recovery of information hidden or destroyed in the source.
- Do not report synthesized/SR-invented detail as recovered ground truth.
- Do not vectorize complex raster texture merely to label the output “vector”.
- Do not lock the architecture to a single AI provider before benchmark evidence.
- Do not let learning automatically modify production without regression and promotion gates.
- Do not require VPS availability for the basic standalone local workflow.

## 32. Open benchmark decisions

The current hardware and deployment profile are now fixed inputs for V1:

```text
Xeon E5-2680 v4
28 cores / 56 logical processors
64 GB RAM
Radeon RX 470 8 GB
SSD
Standalone Windows tool
Remote-first semantic reconstruction
40 GB absolute tool-storage cap
```

Keep these configurable until Harness evidence is available:

- exact remote reasoning/image-provider mappings;
- exact OCR stack;
- which lightweight SR/matting stages benefit from CPU vs RX 470 acceleration;
- vectorization/tracing engine;
- optional experimental local reconstruction model, if any;
- candidate count by quality mode;
- retry/fallback limits;
- QC thresholds;
- provider budget limits;
- exact P50/P90 latency targets after real benchmark runs;
- when region rescue is preferable to full retry;
- whether any local model provides enough quality/latency benefit to justify permanent disk space under the 40 GB cap.

Any validated decision that changes production behavior should update this document so the repository retains one canonical technical history.
